# OFDM PAPR Reduction with Clipping and Filtering

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating an **OFDM system** with **Novel, real-time & protocol independent peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) reduction** .
The implementation demonstrates modulation, clipping, PAPR reduction, optical link simulation (MZM, fiber, photodiode), and performance evaluation.

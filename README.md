# OFDM PAPR Reduction with Clipping and Filtering

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating an **OFDM system** with **Novel, real-time & protocol independent peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) reduction** .
The implementation demonstrates modulation, clipping, PAPR reduction, optical link simulation (MZM, fiber, photodiode), and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Features
- 16-QAM OFDM modulation and demodulation
- Time-domain clipping for PAPR reduction
- Out-of-band distortion filtering
- PSD analysis before and after clipping
- CCDF (Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function) analysis
- Optical modulation and demodulation (MZM, fiber loss, photodiode)
- EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) calculation
- Constellation diagrams and performance comparison

## 🛠 Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or newer
- Communications System Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
